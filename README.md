# Facebook-autoliker
This python script logs into the facebook profile and likes random posts on the facebook news feed.

# How to use
1. Place your facebook username and password in the Creds.py file.
2. Run the auto_facebook.py script. Change the arguments as your need, by default it runs headless and debug mode is off.

# TODO
* Add support for multiple browsers
* Save cookies to avoid login everytime

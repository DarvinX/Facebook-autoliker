# Facebook-autoliker
Python script that takes the hassle of liking the posts of your Facebook friends.

Have you ever wondered why people don't like you ? 

Is it your face, your behaviour or is it because you don't talk to them much ?

Nope, the only reason people don't like you is *you don't like their posts*. Now, fix that with this script.

Note: Don't use it too much, otherwise Facebook will also stop to like you.

# What it does exactly
The python script does login to your Facebook profile, randomly likes posts from your news feeds.

# How to use
1. Place your facebook username and password in the Creds.py file.
2. Run the auto_facebook.py script. Change the arguments as your need, by default it runs headless and debug mode is off.

# TODO
* Add support for multiple browsers.
* Save cookies to avoid login everytime.
* Target specific page or user.
